									<p>There are many ways to market a product or a service and providing the potential clients and customers with testimonials is one of the best ways to market. </p>
									<p>The power of testimonials can never be underestimated. People, especially nowadays, will only purchase products or avail services which have been referred to them by people whom they know. But most of the times, this is not an option that is in the hands of the business owner, he has to do the next best thing, which is to get testimonials from his past clients. Testimonials are living statements from past customers or clients which states that they were satisfied by the product/ service. Every business must have testimonials to be able to stand out in the ever crowded markets.</p>
									<p>Aside from confirming the existence of a business and lessening doubts, testimonials provide assurance to potential customers and clients of the quality of the product or service. The fact that they took time out to be able to write testimonials about the product reflect their levels of satisfaction towards the prod</p>
									<div class="news__item-title ">Testimonials give advantage</div>
									<p>Credible testimonials provide a competitive advantage for the product/service. There are many products and services out there and one of the ways to stand out from the rest is the use of credible testimonials</p>
									<p>There are many types of testimonials. Testimonials are usually categorized according to the source. Here are a few examples:</p>

									<div class="text__desc-wrap">
										<div class="text__desc-title">Testimonials from satisfied customers</div>
										<p> This is probably the most effective type of testimonial. Nothing beats a testimonial from a satisfied customer because it is a picture of what
											the product/service is all about.</p>
										<div class="text__desc-title">Testimonials from experts</div>
										<p>Experts can be credible sources of testimonials. If a renowned dermatologist writes a testimonial for a beauty soap, it will surely help in boosting its sales,
											wouldn’t it?</p>
										<div class="text__desc-title">Testimonials from celebrities</div>
										<p> In a world that is run by mass media, celebrities have become powerful sources of testimonials. Today, even infomercials are infested by testimonials from 			    celebrities. People may think that getting testimonials from celebrities will cost a lot, but if it’s a real testimonial, celebrities may even waive their talent fees.</p>
									</div>

									<p>There is much more to making a testimonial an effective tool for marketing than gethering them. <span class="yellow-text">Good testimonials are the one which can be compressed into a few catchy words.</span>There is much more to making a testimonial an effective tool for marketing than gathering them. Good testimonials are the ones which can be compressed into a few catchy words. “I lost 20 pounds in two weeks time!” is an example of an eye-catching testimonial. However, one must never rephrase or edit what the client had said.</p>

									<div class="article__info">
										Credible testimonials should also contain the complete attributes of the people who gave them. Their titles, location and age should be included whenever possible.
